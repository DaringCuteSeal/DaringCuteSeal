## Who?
Hello, I'm Cikitta. Nothing much, really. I love tech and programming, that's why I'm here.

# My interests ✨

- ⌨️ Typing (~120 WPMs) - [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/profile/Darkowl)
- 🐧 Linox (and other UNIX-related stuff)! I'm an <s>[Archer](https://archlinux.org)</s> <s>[Void](https://voidlinux.org)</s> [Artist](https://artixlinux.org)! I also have Ubuntu Touch, Gentoo, and LFS lying around.
- 🎨 Visual art! I'm an illustrator, animator, and a 3D generalist (been Blendering since 2018.. ah, the 90's UI era)
- 💻 Programming and making my own little scripts! I love Rust btw. (I don't use it that often, but still, Rust ftw)
- 🐾 Animals!
- 💙 Blue!
- 🪐 Philosophy! I love questioning everything but it's terrifying sometimes.
